# STVcalc, an application for fetal STV calculation
The application reads binary fetal cardiotocography (CTG) files and calculates fetal heart rate short term variation (STV), the number of accellerations and of decellerations.
Currently this program works with binary files stored on a server using MOSOS CTG monitoring and archiving software (BMA health care solutions, Houten, the Netherlands) or with txt files with a fetal heart rate sample at 4 Hz (4 / second) per line.
The application's design follows published documentation of the FetalCare system (Huntleigh Healthcare Ltd, Cardiff, UK) for STV calculation. A description of the application and comparison with the FetalCare system is in preparation.
